Yes, I know emojis are cancer. But what if subreddits could have their own emojis?

Reddit Emoji Generator (**REG**) is a website that generates custom CSS and spritesheets to create custom emojis.

**How to use:**

1. **Upload** your emoji images (They will be resized to 32x32 and show up as 16x16 on your sub)
2. **Edit** the names of the emojis.
3. **Save** image as customredditemoji.png then upload the image to your subreddit stylesheet (with the same name).
4. **Copy & Paste** the generated CSS anywhere in your stylesheet.
5. **Use** them like this: \[](#**emojiname**)

Optional: Download the preset to be able to edit the emojis later
